# *Important: For a docking run with HADDOCK, each molecule should consist of 
#Â a single chain with non-overlapping residue numbering within the same chain.
# As an antibody consists of two chains (L+H), we will have to prepare it 
# for use in HADDOCK. For this we will be making use of pdb-tools from the command line.
