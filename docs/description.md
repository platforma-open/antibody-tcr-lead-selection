# Overview

Ranks and selects top antibody or T-cell receptor (TCR) lead candidates from clonotype data based on configurable scoring metrics and filters to prioritize the most promising candidates for downstream characterization and development. The block compiles calculated scores from upstream analysis blocks (e.g., enrichment scores, differential abundance, pairing scores, sequence liabilities) into a comprehensive table and enables multi-criteria ranking to identify optimal lead candidates.

The block first filters candidates using threshold-based criteria on any score column, then ranks the filtered candidates based on multiple scoring metrics with configurable priority order and direction (increasing or decreasing). When cluster information is available, ranking is performed hierarchically: clusters are first sorted by size (largest clusters first), then within each cluster, candidates are sorted by the highest-priority metric, then by the second-priority metric for ties, and so on. Selection uses round-robin sampling across clusters: the top candidate from each cluster is selected first, then the second-best candidate from each cluster, and so on, ensuring diversity across clusters while prioritizing larger clusters and better candidates. When no cluster information is available, candidates are ranked directly by scoring metrics and the top N are selected.

The block provides interactive visualizations including clonotype space UMAP plots, CDR3 spectratype distributions, and V/J gene usage patterns to help evaluate and compare selected leads, streamlining the lead selection process by consolidating multiple data sources and enabling data-driven prioritization of candidates for further experimental validation.
